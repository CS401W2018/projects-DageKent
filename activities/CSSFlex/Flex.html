        <h2>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h2>
        <p>I learned I can achieve flexible layout control by using flex,
             such as display: flex, justify-content, order, flex-wrap, and gap.
              Also, learned to use justify-content: space-evenly; in nav to evenly space links.
            Also, I found that use .featured with order: -1 to change the order. additionally,
             I noticed that flex-wrap will impact item wrapping, and flex-direction can change layout direction.</p>
        <h2>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</h2>
        <p>An accessible website means the website for every one can use it, including people with disabilities.
             Here is an example how does this work. If there is a link in a website, the web designer should make
              very explicit to guide users and convey to users there is a link. The goal is to help and welcome everyone to use the websites you create.
