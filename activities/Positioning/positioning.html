        <P>With its large size and geographic variety,
         the United States includes most climate types.
          East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges
           from humid continental in the north to humid
            subtropical in the south.[193] The western
             Great Plains are semi-arid.[194] Many mountainous
              areas of the American West have an alpine climate.
               The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean
                in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon,
                 Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is
                  subarctic or polar. Hawaii, the southern tip of Florida
                   and U.S. territories in the Caribbean and Pacific are tropical.[195]</P>
