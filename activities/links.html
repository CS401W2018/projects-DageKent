    <h2>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. 
        Why would you use relative links?</h2>
    <p>An absolute link is a full URL. It includes protocols, such as https://. It includes domain names, such as www.google.com. It may also contain the document path, such as /folder/page.html. 
        A relative link means a document in the same project directory. It is always used for local navigation. 
    The reason to use relative links is it can shift projects and avoid dependency on a fixed URL. Also, relative links load faster in local environments. </p>
    
    <h2>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
    <p>First, a relative link refers to a current location document. 
        Second, use / to refer documents from the root directory. 
        Third, use../ to refer documents one more level from the directory.</p>
    
    <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
    <p>Not necessary, links can be placed anywhere on a page. Such as paragraphs, headers, or other elements.</p>
