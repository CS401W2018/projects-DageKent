        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
        <p>JPEG is good for real life pictures, such as landscapes and portraits.</p>
        <h2>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
        <p>GIF is good for images with few colors, such as cartoons and animations</p>
        <h2>What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
        <p>PNG is unique for lossless compression, alpha channel, or transparency.
             It works well for cartoons and logo images. It also has a wider color range than GIF.</p>
        <h2>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
        <p>There are different ways to resize a photo, such as using Microsoft Paint software
             on a Windows computer to resize photo. Or Typing code in a CSS file or
             HTML file to set the width and height in pixels to resize a photo.</p>
        <h2>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h2>
        <p>Photo editing software can reduce file size and increase web page loading speed.
            Photo editing software also can retain quality of images, because use CSS to resize images may make the image blurry.
             An image resized by photo editing software can make CPU calculation faster, because the image is already in the right size, 
            doesn't need additional process.</p>
