        <h2>Name: weihua Kong</h2>
        <h2>The title and topic of your site.</h2>
        <p>Cultural Tourism for China. This is a website of a tourism company that introduces their services.</p>
        <h2>A brief paragraph about why you chose this topic.</h2>
        <p>China is a big country and has a variety of cultures and landscapes. I want to introduce my country to other people.</p>
        <h2>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h2>
        <p>1. The home page: Introduces tourism content and places pictures that attract people. Also, contain links to other pages.
            2. Culture page: Introduce history, customs, etc. Add relative pictures and references.
         3. Tourism landscapes page: To list main landscapes that accompany brief introduction and suggestion. Provide map links and video links.
         4. Group tourism prices page: Create a table that shows different costs for group tourism in terms of size, time, and price. Make the table
          has clear details, such as group of people, activity content, and prices.
          5. Registration form page: Create a form for customers to sign up their information, such as name, contact, group of people, traveling date, etc.
         using JavaScript to process the form submission.
         6. References and links page: Collect all references being used, including website, book, and video links. Ensuring links can be clicked and accessed,
          also add a quote next to the content.</p>
        <h2>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h2>
        <p>I will find references from academic and cultural websites and free-to-use images.
            I will keep original content, such as writing descriptions in my own words based on references.
             Design the table and form based on real tourism data.
             My table will contain different destinations, prices, tourism hours, etc. I will create price data by myself,
              and if I use any external sources to provide tourism suggestions, I will add a quote next to the relative content.</p>
        <h2>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site; list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h2>
        <p> I will collect information from reliable travel websites, from official tourism boards, and free-to-use image sources.
             Two references I plan to use are:
              National Geographic Travel (travel.nationalgeographic.com) Lonely Planet (www.lonelyplanet.com)</p>
        <h2> I have read the warnings below the page on Canvas.</h2>
